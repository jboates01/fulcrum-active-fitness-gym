## Rationale

### Overview of the Project 

The Fulcrum Active Gym website is designed to offer a comprehensive digital solution for gym members to access essential information about the gym. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly, interactive platform where members can learn about the gym facilities, activities, trainers, and schedules, and get in touch through a contact form. By leveraging modern web technologies, the website aims to enhance the overall fitness experience for users of all ages and fitness levels.

### Inspiration and Purpose

The motivation behind creating the Fulcrum Active Gym website stems from the increasing demand for efficient, digital solutions in the fitness industry. With more people seeking convenient ways to manage their fitness routines, there was a clear need for a platform that combines ease of use with robust functionality. This project aims to fill that niche by providing an engaging, interactive experience that meets the diverse needs of gym members.

The inspiration for this project comes from the desire to improve the traditional gym experience by integrating digital tools that offer greater flexibility and accessibility. By addressing common pain points such as accessing gym schedules and trainer information, the Fulcrum Active Gym website seeks to enhance member satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Project Background 

The fitness industry has seen a significant shift towards digitalization, with many gyms adopting online platforms to manage their operations and engage with members. However, existing solutions often lack the intuitive interfaces and comprehensive features needed to meet the evolving demands of users. Recognising this gap, the Fulcrum Active Gym website was conceived to offer a fresh take on gym management by utilising advanced web technologies to create a responsive, dynamic user experience.

The development of this website focuses on ensuring seamless navigation and user interaction. While the initial scope of the project seemed straightforward, several challenges arose that required innovative solutions, ultimately leading to a more robust and user-friendly platform.

### Scope and Limitations of the Project

The scope of the project includes the development of a web-based platform with the following features:
- Information on gym facilities
- Details on gym activities
- Information on trainers with their social media links
- Schedules for gym activities
- A modal interactive contact form
- An interactive location map

Known limitations include:
- Dependence on external APIs for trainer and schedule data, which can affect availability and accuracy.
- Potential browser compatibility issues, despite efforts to ensure cross-browser functionality.

### Identified Challenges

The primary problem that the Fulcrum Active Gym website aims to address is the inefficiency of traditional gym management methods and the lack of engaging, user-friendly digital solutions. Many existing platforms are either too complex for everyday users or lack the features needed to streamline gym operations effectively.

## Development Process

The development of Fulcrum Fitness Gym involved several stages. Below is a detailed explanation of each stage:

### 1. Project Planning and Rationale
The rationale for this application addresses the need for efficient gym management and enhanced member engagement. Gym owners face challenges like membership management, class scheduling, and maintaining user engagement, which traditional methods often fail to solve. This project integrates various aspects into one platform, providing information on gym facilities, trainer social media profiles, member testimonials, special events, and an interactive contact form. By automating tasks, streamlining communication, and offering personalised experiences, the application enhances management efficiency and member satisfaction. This comprehensive approach improves operations and fosters a stronger sense of community and loyalty among gym members.

### 2. Custom HTML and CSS
The application was developed using custom HTML and CSS code, ensuring compliance with official validation standards:
- **HTML Validation:** The HTML code passed through the W3C validator with no issues.
- **CSS Validation:** The CSS code passed through the official Jigsaw validator with no issues, including advanced techniques such as CSS media queries for responsiveness.

## Design Choices

### Choosing a Static Site
- **Performance and Simplicity**: Static sites load faster and are less complex to deploy and maintain compared to dynamic sites.
- **Security**: Fewer security risks as there are no databases or dynamic server-side processing.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Hosting for static websites is generally cheaper, and sometimes free, on platforms like GitHub Pages.

### Layout Decisions
- **Navigation**: Easy-to-use, fixed top navigation bar that remains accessible as users scroll.
- **Typography**: Clear and readable fonts, with a professional look that aligns with the fitness centre's branding.
- **Color Scheme**: Motivating and energetic colours that enhance the user experience and focus on fitness and health.

### Colour Scheme
- The main color scheme for the site includes:  
  - `#092032` (rgb(10, 38, 71))
  - `#516171` (rgb(20, 66, 114))
  - `#f2dd66` (rgb(32, 82, 149))
  - `#dc2543` (rgb(44, 116, 179))
  - `#747ba9` (rgb(44, 116, 179))

### Typography
- The primary font used throughout the website is 'Barlow', with 'Sans Serif' as the fallback font.

### Imagery
- Imagery plays a crucial role in the website, with high-quality images used on the homepage and service pages to illustrate the gym's facilities and activities.

### Wireframes
- Wireframes were created to outline the structure and layout of the website.

Here are the wireframes for the homepage layout:

# Bugs Fixed in the Fulcrum Fitness Website

During the development and ongoing maintenance of the Fulcrum Fitness Website, several key issues were identified and resolved to enhance performance, usability, and security. Below is a list of some significant bugs that were fixed, along with the solutions implemented.

## List of Bugs and Fixes

### 1. Responsive Design Issues
- **Problem:** Certain layout elements were not displaying correctly on mobile devices.
- **Fix:** Adjusted Bootstrap CSS Grids and tested various devices to ensure a consistent and responsive layout across all screen sizes.

### 2. Navigation Link Issues
- **Problem:** Some navigation links for the social icons were not directing to their respective pages.
- **Fix:** Corrected the href attributes in the navigation bar and ensured that all internal links were properly anchored to the respective sections.

### 3. Map Display Errors
- **Problem:** The embedded Google Map was not loading correctly on the Contact Us page due to an incorrect API key configuration.
- **Fix:** Updated the Google Maps API key and adjusted the API settings to ensure the map loaded correctly and remained interactive.

### 4. Broken image links on GitHub
- **Problem:** While the pages loaded correctly on Gitpod, it lost all images and page structure when pushed to GitHub.
- **Fix:** Researched the problem and found some answers from stackoverflow.com which indicated that GitHub did not like image file paths like (../images/image.jpg) and that removing the first / will resolve the problem. Corrected the paths on all images i.e (images/images.jpg) on all pages and tested to ensure that all  image links were properly working on all pages.
