## Design Choices

### Choosing a Static Site
- **Performance and Simplicity**: Static sites load faster and are less complex to deploy and maintain compared to dynamic sites.
- **Security**: Fewer security risks as there are no databases or dynamic server-side processing.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Hosting for static websites is generally cheaper, and sometimes free, on platforms like GitHub Pages.

### Layout Decisions
- **Navigation**: Easy-to-use, fixed top navigation bar that remains accessible as users scroll.
- **Typography**: Clear and readable fonts, with a professional look that aligns with the fitness centre's branding.
- **Color Scheme**: Motivating and energetic colours that enhance the user experience and focus on fitness and health.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and creating a semantic layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design features.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For interactive elements like modal windows, form validation, and handling interactive maps.

## Responsive Design Considerations

- **Flexible Grid Layout**: Ensures that the site's layout adjusts smoothly across devices of varying screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Used extensively to tailor the site's design to different devices, improving usability and readability.
- **Images and Icons**: Employ scalable vector graphics (SVGs) and ensure all images are responsive to fit their containers without distorting the page layout.
- **Testing**: Regular testing on multiple devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

By adhering to these design principles, the Fulcrum Fitness Website aims to deliver a superior user experience, optimized for both functionality and aesthetic appeal across all devices.

# Deployment of the Fulcrum Fitness Website

The Fulcrum Fitness Website was deployed to ensure it is accessible and runs efficiently on all devices. Below is an overview of the deployment process and the technologies used.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Code Preparation and Optimisation
- The complete, tested code was pushed to a GitHub repository, ensuring all assets such as images, Bootstrap codes, Boxicon codes, Owl carousel codes, JQuery and JavaScript files were properly linked.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files minified versions were taken from bootstrap and github to reduce load times and improve the site’s responsiveness.

### 2. Repository Setup and Integration
- The GitHub repository was linked to Gitpod to utilise its continuous deployment features.
- Any updates made and pushed to the GitHub repository are automatically deployed to the live website through Gitpod’s continuous deployment pipeline.

### 4. HTTPS Configuration
- HTTPS was automatically set up through Github, using Let’s Encrypt to provide a secure, encrypted connection for all users.
- This configuration ensures that all data transmitted between the website and its users is secure.

## Post-Deployment Activities
- **Monitoring**: Lighthouse’s monitoring tools were employed to ensure high uptime and address any availability issues promptly.
- **Updates**: Regular updates were made to the site’s content and structure as needed, pushed through GitHub.
- **Analytics**: W3Schools CSS and HTM Validators were used to test the site.

This deployment strategy ensures that the Fulcrum Fitness Website remains robust, responsive, and secure, providing a seamless experience to its users.

# Bugs Fixed in the Fulcrum Fitness Website

During the development and ongoing maintenance of the Fulcrum Fitness Website, several key issues were identified and resolved to enhance performance, usability, and security. Below is a list of some significant bugs that were fixed, along with the solutions implemented.

## List of Bugs and Fixes

### 1. Responsive Design Issues
- **Problem:** Certain layout elements were not displaying correctly on mobile devices.
- **Fix:** Adjusted Bootstrap CSS Grids and tested various devices to ensure a consistent and responsive layout across all screen sizes.

### 2. Navigation Link Issues
- **Problem:** Some navigation links for the social icons were not directing to their respective pages.
- **Fix:** Corrected the href attributes in the navigation bar and ensured that all internal links were properly anchored to the respective sections.

### 3. Map Display Errors
- **Problem:** The embedded Google Map was not loading correctly on the Contact Us page due to an incorrect API key configuration.
- **Fix:** Updated the Google Maps API key and adjusted the API settings to ensure the map loaded correctly and remained interactive.

### 4. Broken image links on GitHub
- **Problem:** While the pages loaded correctly on Gitpod, it lost all images and page structure when pushed to GitHub.
- **Fix:** Researched the problem and found some answers from stackoverflow.com which indicated that GitHub did not like image file paths like (../images/image.jpg) and that removing the first / will resolve the problem. Corrected the paths on all images i.e (images/images.jpg) on all pages and tested to ensure that all  image links were properly working on all pages.
